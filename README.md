  ## Description
  The README-Generator collects standard information from a developer on a given project they are working on to then quickly provide them with a proffesionally formatted readme file that includes the key main sections that should be in all README.md files. This is done with the CLI library inquirer that collects all the input information from the command line.

  ## Installation
  Inquirer must be added to the package.json dependencies in order to run the README-Generator. To do this first you should enter "npm init" into your console to first create your package.json file. Then you will enter "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" into your console to install the correct version of Inquirer to run the README-Generator. Then you may enter "node index.js" to run the generator.
  
  ## Usage
  When a project is nearing completion and a developer ready to create their readme then they can quickly do so without needing to worry about formatting or forgetting key information.
